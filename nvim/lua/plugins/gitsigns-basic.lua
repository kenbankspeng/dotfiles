-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
-- with the first argument being the link and the following
-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
--
-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
--
-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
--
-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do

-- Adds git related signs to the gutter, as well as utilities for managing changes
